# Before you ship

Run through this before opening a PR. Each item links to the reference that explains it.

```bash
pnpm templates:build
pnpm templates:contract
```

Both must be clean. The contract check catches most of what follows; the rest is what only a
human or a rendered frame can see.

---

## Structure

- [ ] The folder lives directly under `templates/`, its name is the template id, and that name
      is in `builtinTemplateNames()`
      ([`apps/studio/src/bootstrap/wiring/templates.ts`](../../apps/studio/src/bootstrap/wiring/templates.ts)).
      The contract check fails on an unregistered folder and on a dangling list entry.
- [ ] The folder carries only `template.json`, `style.scss` (or `style.css`), and optionally
      `filters.svg`. No `.build.*` file is committed.
- [ ] Any binary asset the CSS references lives in the shared [`_assets/`](../_assets) pool and
      is referenced as `url('asset:<filename-without-ext>')`.
      → [css-contract.md](css-contract.md#shared-assets)

## The variable contract

- [ ] The stylesheet reads every universal typography variable through
      `var(--tscaps-<id>, <fallback>)`, so every editor control takes effect. The loader warns
      at load for a missing one, but the audit is faster than waiting for the warning.
      → [style-controls.md](style-controls.md#the-universal-set)
- [ ] `--tscaps-word-spacing` lives on `.word` as `margin` (or as flex `gap` on the parent);
      `--tscaps-line-spacing` on `.line + .line` as `margin-top` (or as `gap` for column
      layouts); `--tscaps-text-decoration` on `.word`, not `.segment`.
- [ ] `line-height` is hardcoded on `.segment`. There is no `--tscaps-line-height`.
- [ ] Every fallback reflects the template's *natural* value, not a neutral one. A template
      whose identity is heavy weight writes `var(--tscaps-font-weight, 800)`.
- [ ] Every `var(--tscaps-…)` and `var(--on-…)` reference has a sensible fallback for the case
      where the variable is unset.
- [ ] Every numeric style control declares `min` / `max` / `step`. Omitting them silently
      inherits `0 / 100 / 0.1`. → [style-controls.md](style-controls.md#declaring-a-control-of-your-own)
- [ ] Controls a primitive declares are **not** also listed in `styleControls`. Read the
      generated `controls.build.json` to see what the template ends up with.
- [ ] Controls that are only about movement carry `"group": "motion"` and the kind they move as
      their subgroup.
- [ ] No `!important` anywhere in the stylesheet. It does not make a rule strong, it makes it
      unreachable, and it silently disables every per-element control the editor offers.
      → [css-contract.md](css-contract.md#cascade-layers-and-why-important-is-banned)

## Animation

- [ ] Every animation uses pattern A or B, or has a stated reason for C or D.
      → [animation.md](animation.md#the-four-patterns)
- [ ] No `transition` declarations anywhere.
- [ ] Every `from` / `0%` keyframe is visually identical to the element's natural
      pre-animation state. A paused animation with a positive delay still leaks its `from` into
      the cascade from the moment the element mounts.
- [ ] No two animations on the same element.
- [ ] Every `animation:` shorthand spells `both` out.
- [ ] Every hand-written animation is declared with `@include declared.animation($id, $element)`,
      and `$element` names the element the rule actually addresses rather than the one whose
      clock it reads. → [animation.md](animation.md#declaring-what-you-apply)
- [ ] Nothing permanent is declared only inside keyframes. A filter, a colour, a stroke or a
      decoration that lives only there disappears the moment a user picks an entrance.
      → [animation.md](animation.md#a-look-that-lives-only-in-keyframes-disappears-when-the-animation-is-replaced)
- [ ] No state class (`word-being-narrated`, …) changes anything that feeds layout.
      → [css-contract.md](css-contract.md#state-classes)
- [ ] A template whose look does not survive being animated declares
      [`features.animation`](template-json.md#feature-opt-outs) for every ancestor kind that
      would break it.

## Rendering

- [ ] Translations smaller than 2 pixels have been verified in an exported video, not only in
      the preview. → [rendering.md](rendering.md#subpixel-rendering)
- [ ] No `px` in `box-shadow`, `text-shadow`, `border` or `outline`. Use `em` or `cqh`, so
      hairlines survive subpixel snapping at 1080p.
- [ ] `font-family` names a family the engine ships.
- [ ] Pseudo-elements on `.segment` / `.line` / `.word` / `.letter` are decorative or
      absolutely positioned in a way that does not displace inline text. The line splitter
      cannot see them. → [rendering.md](rendering.md#how-the-line-splitter-measures)
- [ ] Under letter mode, the animations follow pattern D, the `from` keyframes match the
      `.letter` natural state, and the CSS does not assume continuous letter shaping — no
      kerning, ligatures or cursive joining apply across span boundaries.
      → [css-contract.md](css-contract.md#letter-mode)

## If the template ships a `filters.svg`

→ [filters.md](filters.md)

- [ ] Every `<filter>` has an `id`, and ids are unique inside the file.
- [ ] Filter regions (`x` / `y` / `width` / `height`) are padded generously enough to contain
      the blur, displacement or offset spread. Clipping at glyph edges looks broken.
- [ ] A spreading effect lives on `.segment` with a matching `rendering.padding`, not on
      `.word`.
- [ ] No SMIL elements (`<animate>`, `<set>`, `<animateTransform>`, `<animateMotion>`). They
      are refused at parse time and would freeze in the export anyway.
- [ ] `var()` references inside attribute values have fallbacks where a missing value would
      produce a broken render, and those fallbacks are **bare numbers** — filter scope values
      carry no unit.
- [ ] A filter meant to animate uses `var(--tscaps-tick*)` as a `feTurbulence` seed, or
      pre-defined variants stepped from CSS `@keyframes`.
- [ ] No `--` sequence inside an XML comment. Refer to a control by id (`outline-color`)
      instead of writing the custom property in prose.
- [ ] The template has been tested in Safari if it uses `feDisplacementMap` or `feTurbulence`.
      If it does not render there, declare Safari in `unsupportedUserAgents`.
- [ ] Filter composition preserves any `text-stroke` the template uses: ghosts merge *under*
      the source, not on top of it.
