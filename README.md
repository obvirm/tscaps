# Tscaps

**Add animated captions to any video, in your browser. Free, open source, no account, no upload.**

Tscaps is a client-side subtitle editor for short-form video (TikTok, Reels, Shorts). Drop a video, transcribe it with in-browser Whisper, pick a template, tune the controls, and export the result with captions burned into the pixels. The video never leaves the browser.

Every caption template is CSS. You can pick one from the gallery and tune it with the editor controls (font, size, colour, timing, animation). Or open the CSS tab and write whatever you want. The controls are the surface; CSS is the escape hatch that keeps the door open.

## Sample outputs

Each of these is a caption template that ships in the repository. All rendered by the browser, exported frame by frame.

> [!NOTE]
> Every clip on this page was made with the hosted version at [tscaps.io](https://tscaps.io). There, an LLM reads the transcript and tags some words or phrases. For example, it can tag entities, words to emphasize, the hook of the video, and more. The templates style then the words using these tags, which are referenced as CSS classes.
>
> The local version has the same tagging system, but it doesn't use an LLM, so these semantic tags are not applied automatically. You can still achieve the same result though, since you can manually tag any word.

## Features

**Editor**

- **36 animated caption templates** across five families (Modern, Key moments, Viral, Classic, Lab). Each template ships with colour presets and editor controls for font, size, weight, colour, spacing, animation, and more. CSS is available for anything the controls do not cover.
- **Word-by-word timing.** Each word carries its own start and end. Enables karaoke reveal, per-word emphasis, and per-word style overrides.
- **Per-element editing.** Click a word, a scene, or an emoji in the preview. A panel opens with that element's own typeface, size, weight, colour, rotation, and position. Or write CSS directly for it.
- **Motion controls.** Pick how each scene enters, how words arrive, how emojis move. Each animation has its own timing and easing controls.
- **Multi-sheet styling.** Assign different looks to different parts of the video. Sheets can be linked so a style change rides across all of them.
- **Timeline and cuts.** A waveform timeline where you select and cut silences or unwanted stretches. Auto-cut over silences. Captions realign to the shortened timeline.
- **Text behind subject.** Captions render behind the speaker via on-device person segmentation. No upload, no server.
- **Right-to-left and mixed-script.** Arabic, Hebrew, Persian, Urdu, and mixed-direction text resolves through the Unicode bidirectional algorithm.

**Transcription and I/O**

- **In-browser transcription.** Whisper runs on the device (tiny, base, small, medium). No API key, no account, no audio uploaded.
- **Import SRT or VTT.** The hosted product has free tools at [tscaps.io/tools](https://tscaps.io/tools) for this: drop a video and a subtitle file, style the captions, export. No transcription step, no account.
- **Export subtitle files.** Write the captions back to SRT, VTT, ASS, SBV, or plain text, with optional word-level timing.
- **Frame-accurate video export.** The browser rasterizes the caption DOM at each frame, composites it with the video, and encodes the result to mp4 via WebCodecs.

**For developers**

- **Templates as code.** Each template is a folder of JSON + CSS that anyone can read and edit. Fork the repo and open a PR.
- **Embeddable engine.** The rendering engine ships separately on npm as [`@tscaps/engine`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@tscaps/engine). Embed it in your own product without the editor UI.

## How it works

1. **Drop a video.** The browser reads it through the WebCodecs API.
2. **Transcribe.** In-browser Whisper produces word-level timing. First run downloads the model (about 80 MB), cached after that.
3. **Style.** Pick a template, tune the controls, edit individual words. The live preview overlays the caption DOM on the video.
4. **Export.** For each output frame, the engine rasterizes the caption DOM into a bitmap, composites it with the source frame, and encodes the result back into mp4.

Captions are HTML elements styled with CSS in both preview and export. The browser renders them both times.

## What's in this repository

| Path | What it is |
|---|---|
| [`packages/engine`](packages/engine) | The framework-agnostic TypeScript engine that does the rendering. Published to npm as [`@tscaps/engine`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@tscaps/engine). |
| [`apps/studio`](apps/studio) | The web app that wraps the engine in a UI: drop a video, edit captions, export. |
| [`templates`](templates) | The visual-style gallery the editor consumes. Each template is a folder of JSON and CSS. See [templates/AUTHORING.md](templates/AUTHORING.md) to write one. |

## Tscaps as a hosted product

A hosted version runs at **[tscaps.io](https://tscaps.io)** with two surfaces sharing the same editor:

- **[Local](https://tscaps.io/local).** The same in-browser flow this repository ships. Free, no signup. Transcription via in-browser Whisper. Speed depends on the device.
- **[Cloud](https://tscaps.io).** Server-side transcription (faster, more accurate), AI-driven styling, cross-device project sync. Free tier with a watermark. Paid tiers remove the watermark and raise limits.

The cloud server is not open source. This repository is the open-source equivalent of the local surface: same editor, same engine, same templates, no server in the loop. Self-host it, fork it, or embed the engine in your own product.

## Run the web app

### With Docker (pre-built image)

The fastest path:

```bash
docker run -p 8080:80 ghcr.io/francozanardi/tscaps-web:latest
```

Open `http://localhost:8080`. The image is a static nginx serving the production bundle.

### With Docker (from source)

If you want to customise the build (templates, branding, environment), build the image locally. Build context is the workspace root:

```bash
docker build -f apps/studio/Dockerfile -t tscaps-web .
docker run -p 8080:80 tscaps-web
```

### From source (no Docker)

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm --filter ./apps/studio dev
```

Open the URL the dev server prints. Drop a video and the editor opens with the transcribe flow ready.

To produce a static bundle:

```bash
pnpm --filter ./apps/studio build
```

Output lands in `apps/studio/dist/`.

## Use the engine directly

The engine ships separately so you can embed it in your own product without the editor UI.

```bash
npm install @tscaps/engine
```

```ts
import { RenderPipelineBuilder } from '@tscaps/engine';

const inputVideo: Blob = /* from a file input, fetch, etc. */;

const pipeline = new RenderPipelineBuilder()
  .withInputVideo(inputVideo)
  .build();

const { blob } = await pipeline.run();
// `blob` is a Blob containing the captioned mp4
```

The full pipeline API, every styling knob, every transcriber, every splitter, the document model, and the tag system live in **[packages/engine/README.md](packages/engine/README.md)**, with worked examples and GIFs of each result.

## Templates

A template is a self-contained visual style for burned-in subtitles: a folder containing a `template.json` (metadata, controls, alignment) and a `style.scss` (the visual rules), plus an optional `filters.svg`. The stylesheet is Sass so a template can call the shared primitives under `templates/_lib/`. A build step compiles it to a flat `style.build.css`, and that is what the runtime reads. Nothing resolves at runtime, so the artifact stays editable by anyone who knows CSS.

The author guide is **[templates/AUTHORING.md](templates/AUTHORING.md)**, which builds a template from nothing a step at a time. The deep reference (the full `template.json` schema, the CSS variable contract, animation patterns, the primitive library, SVG filters, the live-vs-export differences, and the author's checklist) lives in **[templates/_docs/](templates/_docs)**.

If you have never written one and want to learn by reading: the existing templates under `templates/` are the canonical examples.

### Contribute a template

Templates are the easiest way to contribute. The CSS contract is documented end to end, the existing folders are working references, and a good template can ship in a single PR with zero build-system changes.

Open a PR with a new folder under `templates/` and the editor picks it up automatically.

## Document model

Every transcriber produces a `Document`. Templates style it. The hierarchy is:

```
Document
└── Section[]   contiguous run, processed by one splitter + tagger chain
    └── Segment[]   one screen-sized caption block, carries a time range
        └── Line[]   one visible line of text within a segment
            └── Word[]   a word with text, time range, and tag set
```

The render layer exposes that tree to CSS through three surfaces: a flat set of CSS classes per element, a flat set of CSS custom properties per element, and a tag system that adds more classes via taggers. Every styling decision a template makes targets one of those three surfaces.

The full description lives in [packages/engine/README.md](packages/engine/README.md#document-model).

## How tscaps compares

Tscaps sits in a gap between closed caption editors and general-purpose video editors. This table is intentionally coarse. Feature sets change; check each product for the current state.

|  | tscaps (this repo) | tscaps.io cloud | Closed caption editors (Submagic, Captions.ai, VEED) | Desktop editors (Premiere, DaVinci, CapCut) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Runs in your browser | Yes | Yes | Most | No |
| Video stays on your device | Yes | No | No | Yes |
| Open source | Yes | No | No | No |
| Free, no watermark | Yes | Free tier, watermarked | Free tier, watermarked | Varies |
| Account required | No | Yes | Yes | No |
| Animated caption templates | 36, CSS-driven, editable | Same + AI styling | Fixed list | Limited |
| Edit template CSS directly | Yes | Yes | No | No |
| Per-word and per-scene overrides | Yes | Yes | Limited | Manual keyframes |
| Timeline with cuts | Yes | Yes | Some | Yes |
| Text behind subject | Yes, on-device | Yes, on-device | No | Manual masking |
| Transcription | On-device Whisper | Server-side (faster) | Server-side | Varies |
| Multi-speaker | Manual | Automatic + manual | Automatic | Manual |
| AI-driven styling | No | Yes | Yes | No |
| SRT / VTT import | Via [tscaps.io/tools](https://tscaps.io/tools) | Via tools + editor | Yes | Yes |
| Subtitle file export | SRT, VTT, ASS, SBV, TXT | Same | Some | Yes |
| Embeddable engine on npm | Yes | N/A | No | No |
| Mobile app | No | No | Some | Yes (CapCut) |

**The positioning is framework, not a preset picker.** Closed tools give you a fixed list of looks. Tscaps gives you a gallery of templates you can read, edit, and extend, with editor controls on top and CSS as the escape hatch.

## FAQ

**Does tscaps upload my video anywhere?**
No, not in this build. The video never leaves the browser. The hosted [tscaps.io](https://tscaps.io) cloud surface does send the audio track to a server for transcription, and stores saved projects for cross-device sync. For a zero-server experience, use [tscaps.io/local](https://tscaps.io/local) or self-host this repository.

**How accurate is the in-browser transcription?**
It depends on the model and the device. Tscaps ships four Whisper models: tiny, base, small, and medium. On a laptop, small is a solid default. On a modern desktop, medium runs well. Phones are slow. If accuracy or speed matters, the cloud transcription at tscaps.io is faster and more accurate.

**Which video formats can I open?**
Anything the browser's WebCodecs API can decode: mp4 (H.264, H.265 on Safari and recent Chrome), webm (VP8, VP9, AV1), mov. Rotated videos are supported.

**Can I import captions from an SRT or VTT file?**
Yes. The hosted product has free tools at [tscaps.io/tools](https://tscaps.io/tools) for this: drop a video and a subtitle file, style the captions, export. No account needed.

**Do I need to know CSS?**
No. The editor has controls for font, size, weight, colour, spacing, animation, and per-element overrides. CSS is available for anything the controls do not cover, but you can style a full video without opening it.

**Can I write my own caption template?**
Yes. A template is a folder with `template.json` (metadata + editor controls) and `style.scss` (the visual rules). See [templates/AUTHORING.md](templates/AUTHORING.md) for a step-by-step guide and [templates/_docs/](templates/_docs) for the reference.

**Is this the same code as tscaps.io/local?**
Yes. The local surface at tscaps.io runs the same editor against the same engine, with no server calls. This repository is that surface, self-hostable.

**Does it work on mobile?**
The editor loads on mobile. In-browser Whisper transcription is slow on phones: a 60-second clip can take a few minutes on a mid-range device. Export is also slower. For mobile, [tscaps.io](https://tscaps.io) runs transcription server-side.

**Why burn the captions into the pixels instead of a subtitle track?**
Two reasons. Subtitle tracks need the player to render them. TikTok, Reels, Shorts, and muted autoplay ignore them. Burned-in captions render everywhere. Second, tscaps captions are animated (word-by-word reveal, per-word emphasis, keyframe transitions). Subtitle formats cannot express that.

**Can I self-host this on my own server?**
Yes. The Docker image `ghcr.io/francozanardi/tscaps-web:latest` is a static build ready to serve. See *Run the web app* above.

**Can I embed the engine in my own product?**
Yes. `@tscaps/engine` on npm is a framework-agnostic TypeScript package. See [packages/engine/README.md](packages/engine/README.md).

**Which browsers work?**
Chrome 94+, Edge 94+, Safari 16.4+, Firefox 130+.

**What is the license?**
The engine is MIT. The editor app is AGPL-3.0. Templates are MIT. See below.
