# @tscaps/engine

A TypeScript engine that adds captions to a video and burns them in — all in the browser, no server involved. It sources captions (in-browser Whisper transcription, an existing `.srt`, or a hand-built `Document`), lays them out through CSS, and exports the result frame-by-frame to a new video.

Captions are HTML elements styled with CSS. On export, the engine rasterizes that DOM at each frame's timestamp into a bitmap and composites it with the video frame. The browser renders the captions.

**See it running:** [tscaps.io/local](https://tscaps.io/local) is a full caption editor built on this engine, transcription and export included, running entirely in the browser with no account and no upload. It is the fastest way to see what the engine does before writing any code against it.

## Install

```bash
npm install @tscaps/engine
```

The engine targets modern browsers (Chrome 94+, Edge 94+, Safari 16.4+, Firefox 130+) and requires WebCodecs, Web Audio, and Canvas APIs. Node ≥20 is needed only for development tooling; the engine itself does not run in Node.

## Quick start

The minimum-viable consumer: feed a video in, get back a captioned `Blob`. With no transcriber supplied, the engine downloads a Whisper model on first run (~80MB, cached after) and transcribes the audio itself.

```ts
import { RenderPipelineBuilder } from '@tscaps/engine';

const inputVideo: Blob = /* from a file input, fetch, etc. */;

const pipeline = new RenderPipelineBuilder()
  .withInputVideo(inputVideo)
  .build();

const { blob } = await pipeline.run();
// `blob` is a Blob containing the captioned mp4
```

## Examples

The examples below build on each other and share two fixtures so each variation is easy to compare side by side:

**The clip** — a short demo video the engine renders captions onto:

![Input clip](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/francozanardi/tscaps/main/packages/engine/docs/demo.gif)

**The SRT** — caption text and cue timings used as input to `SrtTranscriber` throughout:

```srt
1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,500
Welcome to the engine.

2
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:05,500
Captions burned in the browser.

3
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:08,000
No server, no editor.
```

### 1. From an SRT file

Feed the engine a hand-authored `.srt`. `SrtTranscriber` parses cues into a `Document` and skips the Whisper model entirely. Default styling: bold white text, bottom-center, with a soft shadow.

```ts
import { RenderPipelineBuilder, SrtTranscriber } from '@tscaps/engine';

const srt = await (await fetch('/captions.srt')).text();

const pipeline = new RenderPipelineBuilder()
  .withInputVideo(inputVideo)
  .withTranscriber(new SrtTranscriber(srt))
  .build();

const { blob } = await pipeline.run();
```

### 2. Custom caption style

Hand the pipeline a CSS string. The default selectors are `.segment`, `.line`, and `.word`; the engine attaches those classes to the rendered DOM. Container units (`cqh`, `cqw`) scale sizes against the video frame. `-webkit-text-stroke` paired with `paint-order: stroke fill` paints the outline outside the glyph instead of bleeding into it.

```ts
const captionCss = `
  .segment {
    font-family: system-ui, -apple-system, sans-serif;
    font-weight: 800;
    font-size: 6cqh;
    color: #ffd400;
    -webkit-text-stroke: 0.06em #000;
    paint-order: stroke fill;
    text-shadow: 0 0.1em 0.3em rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.6);
    text-align: center;
    line-height: 1.2;
  }
  .line { display: block; text-align: center; }
  .word { display: inline-block; margin: 0 0.15em; }
`;

const pipeline = new RenderPipelineBuilder()
  .withInputVideo(inputVideo)
  .withTranscriber(new SrtTranscriber(srt))
  .withCss(captionCss)
  .build();

const { blob } = await pipeline.run();
```

### 3. Caption position

Captions default to bottom-center. To move them, pass an `AlignmentConfig` — fractions of the video's width and height as the anchor point, plus which edge of the caption box lands on that point.

```ts
const pipeline = new RenderPipelineBuilder()
  .withInputVideo(inputVideo)
  .withTranscriber(new SrtTranscriber(srt))
  .withCss(captionCss)
  .withAlignment({
    verticalAlign: 'top',
    verticalOffset: 0.12,
    horizontalAlign: 'center',
    horizontalOffset: 0.5,
  })
  .build();

const { blob } = await pipeline.run();
```

### 4. One word at a time (splitters)

The engine pipes the `Document` through a `SegmentSplitter` and a `LineSplitter` before rendering. Override them to force exactly one word per segment and one line per segment, then style each word as a large standalone caption.

```ts
import {
  RenderPipelineBuilder,
  SrtTranscriber,
  LimitByWordsSegmentSplitter,
} from '@tscaps/engine';

const singleWordCss = `
  .segment {
    font-family: system-ui, -apple-system, sans-serif;
    font-weight: 900;
    font-size: 11cqh;
    color: #ffffff;
    -webkit-text-stroke: 0.05em #000;
    paint-order: stroke fill;
    text-shadow: 0 0.12em 0.3em rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.6);
    text-align: center;
    line-height: 1.1;
  }
  .line { display: block; text-align: center; }
  .word { display: inline-block; }
`;

const pipeline = new RenderPipelineBuilder()
  .withInputVideo(inputVideo)
  .withTranscriber(new SrtTranscriber(srt))
  .withSegmentSplitter(new LimitByWordsSegmentSplitter({ maxWords: 1 }))
  .withDefaultLineSplitterConfig({ maxLines: 1 })
  .withCss(singleWordCss)
  .build();

const { blob } = await pipeline.run();
```

![One word at a time](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/francozanardi/tscaps/main/packages/engine/docs/readme-single-word.gif)

### 5. Karaoke highlight (state classes)

Every word carries a state class that reflects the current playback time: `word-not-narrated-yet`, `word-being-narrated`, or `word-already-narrated`. Target those classes in CSS to recolour each word as it plays.

```ts
const karaokeCss = `
  .segment {
    font-family: system-ui, -apple-system, sans-serif;
    font-weight: 800;
    font-size: 6cqh;
    -webkit-text-stroke: 0.06em #000;
    paint-order: stroke fill;
    text-shadow: 0 0.1em 0.3em rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.6);
    text-align: center;
    line-height: 1.2;
  }
  .line { display: block; text-align: center; }
  .word {
    display: inline-block;
    margin: 0 0.15em;
    color: #ffffff;
  }
  .word.word-being-narrated  { color: #ffd400; }
  .word.word-already-narrated { color: #b0b0b0; }
`;

const pipeline = new RenderPipelineBuilder()
  .withInputVideo(inputVideo)
  .withTranscriber(new SrtTranscriber(srt))
  .withCss(karaokeCss)
  .build();

const { blob } = await pipeline.run();
```

![Karaoke highlight](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/francozanardi/tscaps/main/packages/engine/docs/readme-karaoke.gif)

### 6. Animation driven by playback timing

The engine also exposes CSS custom properties that encode timing relative to the current frame — `--on-segment-starts`, `--on-line-being-narrated-starts`, `--word-being-narrated-duration`, and so on. Use them as `animation-delay` (or `animation-duration`) so a single keyframe rule plays in sync with the narration, frame after frame.

```ts
const slideInCss = `
  @keyframes segment-slide-in {
    from { transform: translateY(0.5em); opacity: 0; }
    to   { transform: translateY(0); opacity: 1; }
  }
  .segment {
    font-family: system-ui, -apple-system, sans-serif;
    font-weight: 800;
    font-size: 6cqh;
    text-align: center;
    line-height: 1.2;
    padding: 0.2em 0.6em;
    border-radius: 0.25em;
    background: rgba(255, 212, 0, 0.92);
    color: #111;
    animation: segment-slide-in 0.35s var(--on-segment-starts) ease-out both;
  }
  .line { display: block; text-align: center; }
  .word { display: inline-block; margin: 0 0.1em; }
`;

const pipeline = new RenderPipelineBuilder()
  .withInputVideo(inputVideo)
  .withTranscriber(new SrtTranscriber(srt))
  .withCss(slideInCss)
  .build();

const { blob } = await pipeline.run();
```

![Slide-in animation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/francozanardi/tscaps/main/packages/engine/docs/readme-slide-in.gif)

## Document model

Every transcriber produces a `Document` whose hierarchy is:

```
Document
└── Section[]   contiguous run, processed by one splitter + tagger chain
    └── Segment[]   one screen-sized caption block, carries a time range
        └── Line[]   one visible line of text within a segment
            └── Word[]   a word with text, time range, and tag set
```

The pipeline restructures the same `Word`s into different `Segment`s and `Line`s through `SegmentSplitter` and `LineSplitter`; the underlying word data (`text`, `time`, `tags`) does not change.

The render layer exposes that document to CSS through four surfaces: a flat set of CSS classes per element, a flat set of CSS custom properties per element, a tag system that adds more classes via taggers, and an opt-in `data-tscaps-el` attribute for reaching one element by id. Everything the examples above target — `.word`, `.word-being-narrated`, `--on-segment-starts`, `var(--on-line-being-narrated-starts)` — comes from these surfaces.

`Section` never renders as an element: it is the grouping that decides which splitter and tagger chain a run of segments goes through, and the rendered subtree starts at `.segment`.

### CSS classes the engine emits

Every rendered element carries its element class:

- `.segment` — a caption block, the root of the rendered subtree
- `.line` — a visible line within a segment
- `.word` — a single word within a line
- `.letter` — a single letter within a word, emitted only when `rendering.splitWordsIntoLetters` is `true`
- `.word-decoration` — a decoration attached to a word (an emoji, for instance)

State classes — computed per frame from the current playback time and attached to the matching `.word` / `.line`:

- `word-not-narrated-yet`, `word-being-narrated`, `word-already-narrated`
- `line-not-narrated-yet`, `line-being-narrated`, `line-already-narrated`

Positional tags from `StructureTagger`, assigned once after splitting:

- `first-word-in-line`, `last-word-in-line`
- `first-word-in-segment`, `last-word-in-segment`
- `first-word-in-section`, `last-word-in-section`
- `first-line-in-segment`, `last-line-in-segment`
- `first-line-in-section`, `last-line-in-section`
- `first-segment-in-section`, `last-segment-in-section`
- `first-segment-in-document`, `last-segment-in-document`

Classes on elements the renderer creates rather than on document nodes, collected in the `CssClass` enum:

- `behind-actor-active` — on `.segment` while the text-behind-actor effect is active for it
- `tscaps-video-frame-layer` — the layer holding the video frame, emitted inside `.segment` when `rendering.videoFrame.required` is set
- `segment-decorations-above`, `segment-decorations-below` — the containers of decorations lifted out of line flow

Semantic tag classes come from `Tagger` implementations you add to the pipeline (see *Tags and taggers* below) and are entirely consumer-defined.

### Addressing one element

A class reaches every element of its kind. To reach a single one, name its id in `SubtitleStyle.addressableElementIds` and the renderer stamps `data-tscaps-el="<id>"` (`DataAttribute.ELEMENT_ID`) on it:

```ts
.withSubtitleStyles({ default: { ...style, addressableElementIds: new Set([word.id]) } })
```

```css
[data-tscaps-el="<id>"] { color: #ff5c8a; }
```

Any element id qualifies — segment, line, word or decoration. A word the bidirectional algorithm paints in two places gets the attribute on both pieces. The attribute is serialized once per element per rendered tile, so a caption with every word addressed grows the batch by a double-digit percentage; address nothing and it costs nothing.

### CSS custom properties

Each rendered element exposes timing values relative to the current frame, so you can drive `animation-delay`, `animation-duration`, or any other CSS value from the narration timeline. `--on-…-starts` and `--on-…-ends` are seconds until the event; they go negative once the event is in the past. `--…-duration` is a span.

Segment-level timing:

- `--on-segment-starts`, `--on-segment-ends`, `--segment-duration`

Per-state timing, for both `.line` and `.word` (substitute `<elem>` with `line` or `word`):

- `--on-<elem>-not-narrated-yet-starts`, `--on-<elem>-not-narrated-yet-ends`, `--<elem>-not-narrated-yet-duration`
- `--on-<elem>-being-narrated-starts`, `--on-<elem>-being-narrated-ends`, `--<elem>-being-narrated-duration`
- `--on-<elem>-already-narrated-starts`, `--on-<elem>-already-narrated-ends`, `--<elem>-already-narrated-duration`

Letter-level, when splitting into letters:

- `--letter-index`, `--letter-count`

Structural metadata — unitless integers, so a rule can stagger, scale or branch by an element's position and size without randomness. No `on-` prefix, because they are not events:

- `--segment-index` — the segment's 0-based position within its section
- `--segment-char-count` — character length of the segment's full text, the input for auto-shrink rules
- `--word-index` — the word's 0-based position within its line
- `--word-count` — on `.segment` and on `.line`; the nearest ancestor wins for a `.word` reading it
- `--word-char-count` — code-point length of the word's display text
- `--last-word-char-count` — on `.segment` and on `.line`; the length of the closing word, without traversing to it

Layout and frame:

- `--subtitle-region-width`, `--subtitle-region-height`, `--subtitle-region-x`, `--subtitle-region-y` — the caption region's box, useful when positioning relative to the video frame
- `--video-frame` — the underlying video frame as `url("data:image/jpeg;base64,…")`, only set when `rendering.videoFrame.required` is `true` (see [docs/RENDERING_INTERNALS.md](docs/RENDERING_INTERNALS.md))
- `--segment-padding-top`, `--segment-padding-bottom` — the padding the renderer put on the segment to give a filter room to spread

Read by the engine's own baseline rules, so a stylesheet writes them rather than reading them:

- `--decoration-font-size-multiplier`, `--decoration-gap-multiplier` — how large a decoration renders next to its word, and how far from it

### Tags and taggers

A `Tag` is a CSS class the engine attaches to an element of the document. The engine recognises three sources:

- **Structural tags** are assigned by `StructureTagger`, which runs once after splitting and encodes each element's positional role within its container (the list above under *CSS classes*). The structural tagger is part of every default pipeline; you can target these classes without writing any tagger yourself.
- **Semantic tags** are assigned by `Tagger` implementations that pattern-match against word data. Built-ins: `RegexTagger` (matches a regex against the word text), `WordlistTagger` (membership in a set of strings), `SpanTagger` (a contiguous range of words by index). Build your own by extending the `Tagger` abstract class. Attach them through `.addTagger(...)` or `.withTaggers([...])` on the builder.
- **State tags** — `word-being-narrated`, `line-already-narrated`, etc. — are computed at render time from the current playback timestamp. They are never stored on the `Word` or `Line`; the engine just derives them per frame.

Tags map one-to-one onto CSS classes through `Tag.toCssClass()`. Unknown tag classes are silently ignored by CSS, so adding a new tag category is additive — it never breaks existing stylesheets.

## What else the engine can do

The examples above cover the common cases. The pipeline exposes more knobs you'll reach for as your needs grow:

- **Built-in transcribers**: `WhisperTranscriber` (the default, in-browser Whisper, with a `tiny` / `base` / `small` / `medium` model ladder), `SrtTranscriber` and `VttTranscriber` (parse SubRip and WebVTT, reading per-word timings where the file carries them), `PassthroughTranscriber` (wraps a pre-built `Document`). Or implement your own by satisfying the `Transcriber` interface.
- **Writing subtitle files**: `SubtitleFileSerializer` is the inverse of the parsers. `SrtSubtitleFileSerializer`, `VttSubtitleFileSerializer`, `AssSubtitleFileSerializer`, `SbvSubtitleFileSerializer`, `TtmlSubtitleFileSerializer` and `TextSubtitleFileSerializer` each declare their own media type and extension, and `granularity: 'word'` asks for per-word timing where the format can express it.
- **Right-to-left and mixed-script text**: each line is resolved through the Unicode bidirectional algorithm and its words are emitted in painting order. `RenderingConfig.textDirection` supplies the paragraph direction, `TextDirectionDetector` infers it from a text, and `AlignmentConfig.horizontalAlign` additionally accepts `start` / `end` so one declaration can follow the reading direction.
- **Cuts**: time ranges declared on a `Document` are removed from the exported video, and captions realign to the shortened timeline.
- **Segment splitters**: the default `CompositeSegmentSplitter` chains a sentence-boundary cut with a scaled-character budget. Individual strategies are exposed for custom chains — `BoundarySegmentSplitter`, `LimitByWordsSegmentSplitter`, `LimitByScaledCharsSegmentSplitter`, `PauseBasedSegmentSplitter`, `SpeakerChangeSegmentSplitter`.
- **Line splitters**: `BalancedLineSplitter` (char-balanced, no measurer needed) and `BalancedPixelWidthLineSplitter` (pixel-balanced, backed by a `TextMeasurer` — `DomProbeCanvasTextMeasurer` is the default measurer).
- **Replace any stage**: `withTranscriber`, `withSegmentSplitter`, `withLineSplitter`, `withVideoRenderer`, `withSubtitleFrameRenderer`, `withOverlayFrameRenderer`. Defaults stay in place until explicitly replaced.
- **Tweak default-stage configs without rebuilding them**: `withDefaultSegmentSplitterConfig({ maxChars, minChars, ... })`, `withDefaultLineSplitterConfig({ maxLines, maxWidthRatio, ... })`.
- **Output control**: `withOutputFormat('mp4' | 'webm')`, `withOutputResolution(width, height)`, `withQuality(...)`, `withOutputStream(...)` for streaming the encoded bytes as they're produced.
- **Per-step execution**: `runTranscriptionStep`, `runSplittingStep`, `runStructuralTaggingStep`, `runSemanticTaggingStep`, `runEffectsStep`, `runRenderingStep`. Useful when you want to inspect or hand-edit the `Document` between stages — `getDocument()` and `setDocument(doc)` give you read/replace access.
- **Progress reporting**: `run` accepts a callback that fires through every pipeline stage — Whisper model download, transcription, splitting, tagging, effects, and per-frame rendering progress.
- **Effects and semantic taggers**: pure document-transforming stages (smart punctuation, lowercase, regex/wordlist taggers, etc.) added via `addEffect` and `addTagger`.
- **Multi-style captions**: `withSubtitleStyles({ kindA: ..., kindB: ... })` for documents with multiple `Section.kind` groups, each carrying its own visual rule.

Full type definitions and inline JSDoc ship in `dist/index.d.ts`. Runnable browser and CLI consumers live in [`examples/`](examples) in the source repository.

## Going deeper

For the parts of the engine that sit below the public pipeline API — how each output frame is sampled into a bitmap via SVG `<foreignObject>`, how MediaBunny powers the encode, the browser caveats that come with that approach, how to feed the underlying video frame into your caption styles, and how SVG filters are authored — see [docs/RENDERING_INTERNALS.md](docs/RENDERING_INTERNALS.md).

## Project status

Pre-1.0. The public API surface is stabilising but may shift between minor versions until `1.0`. Pin to an exact version in production and review the changelog before upgrading.
