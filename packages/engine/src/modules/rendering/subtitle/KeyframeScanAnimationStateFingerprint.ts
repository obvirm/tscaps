 * Anything else is never comparable.
 *
 * Coarse: a style is answered for as a whole, so one animation
 * anywhere in it makes every timestamp incomparable, however still the
 * segment being described happens to be.
 *
 * Defining a `@keyframes` counts even where nothing applies it, which
 * is what covers `animation: var(--name)` — the name is not in the
 * declaration to be found, and only the block gives it away.
 *
 * Every source of CSS the style carries is read, including the inline
 * styles its overrides put on single elements.
 *
 * Read once per style: a prepared style's CSS does not change, and it
 * can carry embedded font faces, which makes it large. The answer is
 * held against the style itself, so one prepared from different CSS is
 * never given another's.
