/**
 * Extends each matching segment's end time so it does not snap shut at its
 * last word. When the next matching segment begins within `maxGapMs` the
 * segment is stretched all the way to that boundary, eliminating the
 * micro-gap. When the gap is larger (or there is no next segment at all)
 * the segment is still padded by `maxGapMs` so its tail does not feel
 * abrupt — for the final segment that extension is clamped to
 * `videoDurationSeconds` so it never spills past the end of the video.
 * `segmentFilter` scopes which segments get extended; non-matching
 * segments are still treated as barriers when looking for the next
 * boundary.
 *
 * Padding is measured from the segment's last word and written to
 * `effectTime`, which the effect never reads back. Both halves of that
 * matter: reading `time.end` would fold the previous stamp into the
 * computation and add another `maxGapMs` on every re-run, and writing
 * to `customTime` would make the stamp indistinguishable from a window
 * a caller named — at which point the only way to avoid overwriting the
 * caller is to refuse to shrink, and the padding can never follow the
 * words back down again. Owning a field of its own lets the result be
 * recomputed from nothing but word boundaries, so it grows, shrinks and
 * disappears as the words move.
 *
 * A segment carrying an explicit `customTime` is left alone: a caller
 * who named a window outranks this pass.
