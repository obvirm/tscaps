/**
 * `SubtitleLayerSource` for sections whose stylesheets sample the
 * underlying video pixels — a backdrop blur, a frame-fed filter, text
 * behind the actor.
 *
 * Such a caption cannot be rendered ahead of the video the way a
 * document-driven one can: its picture is only knowable once the frame
 * beneath it exists. So the source batches the other way round, over
 * frames the caller has already gathered: it publishes the whole run
 * into a `BufferedVideoFrameSource` and asks the renderer for all of
 * their tiles in one go, so a run of frames costs one rasterization
 * instead of one each.
 *
 * The caller decides how large a run to gather, and {@link lookAhead}
 * tells it what this source can use — which is however many tiles the
 * renderer's sheet holds, since a run longer than that would spill into
 * a second rasterization and buy nothing.
