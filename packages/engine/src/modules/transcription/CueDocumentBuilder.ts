/**
 * Builds a Document from the cue blocks of a caption file: blank lines
 * separate cues, a `-->` line states the range, and everything below it
 * is the text. Each cue becomes one Segment holding one Line.
 *
 * A counter or identifier above the range line is ignored, since
 * neither says anything the Document keeps. A cue whose text is empty
 * is dropped. How the text becomes timed words is the reader's business
 * and the only thing that differs between formats.
 *
 * A block carrying no range line is skipped and handed back in the
 * result rather than ending the read. This is what the WebVTT parser
 * algorithm prescribes, and it is the only behaviour that serves
 * someone holding a file they did not write: one stray blank line
 * inside a cue, or one paragraph of prose at the end, would otherwise
 * cost them every cue in the file. Deciding whether the remainder is
 * worth using belongs to the caller, which is why the count of what
 * was lost travels with it.
 *
 * A file where every block was skipped is refused outright: what is
 * left is not a thin transcript, it is no transcript, and returning
 * one would say the file was silent rather than unreadable. A file
 * with no blocks at all is not refused — there is nothing in it to
 * misread.
 *
 * A malformed *timecode* still throws. That block announced its
 * intent to state a time and got it wrong, so placing its text
 * anywhere would be a guess.
