 * without any WebCodecs support and never decodes the video track —
 * the result holds the audio at its original bitrate and nothing
 * else.
 *
 * The track comes out whole or split into segments of a bounded
 * length, each a stand-alone container that decodes on its own.
 * Segments overlap: to reassemble them, drop each one's lead-in —
 * everything before its `usableFromSeconds` — and place the rest at
 * that timestamp. Placing a segment anywhere else, or appending it
 * to the previous one, loses the seam.
 *
 * Each segment's first packet is shifted to zero, which the muxer
 * requires. A whole-track remux keeps whatever lead-in the source
 * has and only corrects AAC's negative priming timestamp, a bias
 * bounded by the priming itself (~20 ms).
 *
 * Throws a plain `Error` when the source has no audio track, when
 * the container cannot carry its codec, and when the track holds no
 * packets at all; callers wrap it into their own error vocabulary.
