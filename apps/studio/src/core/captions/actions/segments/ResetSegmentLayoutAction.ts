 * Reverts a single segment to auto-layout: drops its own style and the

 * sheet's pipeline, merging back into adjacent unfrozen neighbours.
 *
 * Everything keyed to the segment goes, because the reflow can dissolve
 * the segment into its neighbours and take its id with it — state left
 * behind would survive as an entry nothing renders.
