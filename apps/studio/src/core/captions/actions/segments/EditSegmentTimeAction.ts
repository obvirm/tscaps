/**
 * Edits a segment's on-screen window. Stored as `customTime`; words are
 * untouched.
 *
 * The window is held clear of the hard time of the segments **on its
 * own sheet**: two of them claiming an instant would be two texts in one
 * channel with nowhere to draw the second. Segments on other sheets are
 * not walls — sheets are exactly how a document says two things are
 * meant to be said at once, and each is read in a channel of its own.
 *
 * Their gap-free padding is not a wall either — but only because the
 * effects are re-stamped here. Writing the window without that left the
 * neighbour's padding parked where it was, so a scene grown into it ended
 * up sharing instants with a window nothing had recomputed, and a document
 * reports every segment covering an instant as active: both captions would
 * have been drawn at once.
 *
 * Shrinking past the segment's own words stays a deliberate escape
 * hatch, and callers visualize the word range to keep the consequence
 * visible. It takes nothing from anyone else.
 *
 * The video's own ends are a wall for the same reason as always: no
 * frame is rendered outside them, so a window reaching past either end
 * is time the export can only drop.
