/**
 * Applies a structural edit (split/merge line or segment, move words across
 * boundaries) to the current document, retags it, and freezes every segment
 * whose word composition differs from the pre-edit document so subsequent
 * style edits don't undo the manual layout the user just produced.
 *
 * A word carried over a segment boundary is pulled inside the window its
 * new segment may occupy. Two words of one segment are allowed to narrate
 * at once because the segment orders them; split across two segments there
 * is no such order, and both captions would be drawn at once. Clamping
 * happens before the effects are re-stamped, so the derived padding settles
 * against the times that will actually be kept.
