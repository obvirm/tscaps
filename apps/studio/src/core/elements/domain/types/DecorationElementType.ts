/**
 * A glyph riding a word — today, an emoji.
 *
 * Offers almost nothing the words around it offer, because almost none
 * of it means anything here: an emoji has no typeface to pick and no
 * colour to set, and asking for either would be a field that changes
 * nothing on screen. What is left is how big it is, how far it is
 * turned, and where it sits.
 *
 * Its size is the same relative one a word takes. A glyph is sized
 * against the word it rides in the first place, so keeping it that way
 * is what lets a template that grows short lines carry the glyph up
 * with them — the growth arrives through the word, and a ratio follows
 * it without anyone arranging for it to.
