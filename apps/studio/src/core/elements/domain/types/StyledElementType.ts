/**
 * What one kind of addressable element can be told about itself.
 *
 * Four answers, and they are independent. Which fields it offers is
 * the list; how those fields reach the painted text is the surface;
 * which animations it can be given is a separate list, because an
 * element that wraps words can be told how they enter as well as how
 * it does; whether it can be lifted out of the line and anchored in
 * the frame is none of them, because a placement never becomes a
 * declaration and has nothing in the CSS to lose to.
 *
 * A new kind of element — a GIF, a widget — is a new class here. It
 * reuses whichever fields already say what it needs, and nothing about
 * the fields, the store or the panels has to learn its name.
