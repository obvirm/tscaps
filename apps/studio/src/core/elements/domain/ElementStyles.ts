 * How each element is styled, keyed by the element's id.

 * A field's value is recorded here and declared in `css`, and the two
 * are written together. Nothing ever reads the CSS to find out what a
 * field holds — the record already knows. The only question ever asked
 * of the text is whether it still carries the exact declaration the
 * recorded value would write; when it does not, the CSS was edited by
 * hand and the field says so instead of arguing with it.
 *
 * An animation is recorded the same way and written the same way, and
 * its block goes first — so anything after it outranks it, exactly as
 * a field is outranked. What it takes to swap one is the difference: a
 * field owns a declaration, an animation owns a set of them plus its
 * keyframes, so the last one comes out whole rather than being
 * overwritten in place.
 *
 * An element can hold one animation per part of itself, so they are
 * keyed by scope. Two blocks in one text never collide: each carries
 * the selector and the clock its scope resolves to, so no two of them
 * can read the same.
 *
 * One store spans every kind of element — word, segment, decoration,
 * and whatever gains an id next. The kind rides along because the id
 * alone cannot tell a segment from a word, and both the clock an
 * entrance anchors to and the reflow exclusions depend on it.
 *
 * Immutable. `with` returns a new instance; an entry with neither an
 * entrance nor CSS is dropped, so `has` reflects what actually renders.
