/**
 * Picks the best available {@link ExportWriter} for the current runtime
 * by asking each candidate's static `isSupported`. Only the chosen
 * writer is instantiated — the others are never constructed, so a
 * writer's constructor side effects (worker spawn, file handles) never
 * fire on environments that would not have used it anyway.
 *
 * Preference order: a streaming file picker (desktop Chromium), then
 * OPFS + `<a download>` (mobile Chromium, Firefox, Safari), then an
 * in-memory buffer (always available).
 *
 * Mobile is steered away from the file picker even when supported: on
 * Android, `showSaveFilePicker` launches a system intent that
 * backgrounds the tab, and the OOM killer routinely terminates
 * memory-pressured tabs while that intent is in front. The OPFS path
 * keeps the tab in the foreground and downloads the finished file via
 * an anchor.
