 * the same way.
 *
 * The case it exists for is `mix-blend-mode`. A caption that blends with
 * the video needs no stacking context between the blending element and
 * the frame, and every entrance in the library animates `transform` or
 * `opacity` — either of which puts one there. Measured in both engines:
 * even `translateY(0)` isolates, and the frozen-frame model keeps the
 * fill applied, so the blend does not come back when the entrance ends.
 *
 * Exhaustive over `ElementKind`: a kind added later cannot compile
 * without an answer, so nothing is quietly assumed to be animatable.
