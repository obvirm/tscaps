/**
 * Flags every animation a stylesheet applies without declaring it.
 *
 * An undeclared animation is not a broken template — it renders — and
 * that is what makes it worth catching here. The editor reads the
 * record to say what a template does to each kind of element, so an
 * animation missing from it comes out as "None": a panel stating the
 * captions hold still, over captions that move. Nothing downstream can
 * tell that apart from a template that genuinely animates nothing.
 *
 * Matched on the `@keyframes` names each declaration claims rather
 * than on the animation's id, so a template is free to name its
 * animation one thing and its blocks another, and an animation made of
 * two blocks says so.
 *
 * Stands down when the record is absent — a template loaded for
 * editing carries no build-time registry, and a rule that reported
 * everything as undeclared there would be noise.
