 * sheet answering for every caption and one caption answering for
 * itself both write onto a segment — so support is asked of the kind
 * rather than of the panel. `owner` is the element whose panel this is,
 * which is what a scope meaning "the element itself" lands on, and is
 * `null` for a sheet, which is not an element.
