 * what it was given all come from what the stylesheet declared while
 * compiling. Each field starts on the value the template wrote, so
 * opening the panel shows the caption as it is rather than a set of
 * zeroes.
 *
 * **Only the animations declared on this kind of element.** A tuned
 * value is a declaration on the scope's own elements, and an element's
 * own declaration beats one it inherits whatever layer that came from
 * — so a dial over an animation living further in would move nothing.
 * A template that fades its captions and floats their words answers
 * two scopes, one each, however the two are clocked.
 *
 * A field with nothing to start on is left out. That covers a value
 * the template said two ways, and one with no number under it because
 * the template routed it through a variable of its own: the animation
 * runs either way, and only the dial cannot open.
