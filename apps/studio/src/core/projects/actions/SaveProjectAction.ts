/**
 * Persists the current editor state into the active Project's record.
 * Skips silently if no project is open (state.projectId is null), so the
 * caller does not need to gate the call.
 *
 * Also skips when the payload would be byte-for-byte what the last
 * successful save already wrote, so a caller that saves on every pass
 * costs nothing when there is nothing to write. The comparison is on
 * content rather than on the `dirty` flag because state reaches the
 * store through paths that never raise it, and a save that skipped one
 * of those would drop work.
 *
 * If the user edits the project while a save is in flight, the running
 * save still persists the *original* snapshot — the edits remain
 * unsaved (`dirty` stays true) so the next save catches them up.
 *
 * Does not re-cache the video blob — that is owned by CreateProjectAction
 * and never changes for the lifetime of a project.
 *
 * Every failure leaves as a `ProjectSaveFailedError` carrying the
 * original error in `cause`, so callers report a failed save without
 * inspecting whatever the storage layer threw.
