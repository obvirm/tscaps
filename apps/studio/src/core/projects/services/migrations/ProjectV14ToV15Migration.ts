/**
 * v14 → v15: moves where an element sits into the element's own style,
 * and leaves the segment overrides holding nothing but the
 * behind-actor answer, under a name that says so.
 *
 * Everything the editor knows about one element now lives under that
 * element's id. The two stores that remained were a placement each,
 * keyed the same way and cleared by different rules, and every reader
 * had to ask both and merge.
 *
 * Anchors are stamped on the way through. A position written before
 * the anchor was kept beside its offset carries the offset alone, and
 * a placement is now all four parts or nothing — so an offset that
 * arrived without its anchor would be dropped and the element would
 * snap back into the flow. What the sheet holds today is the anchor
 * that position was last read against, so stamping it freezes the
 * element where it already is.
