   *   does not compete with audio extraction. Encoding then runs
   *   alongside the transcribe HTTP roundtrip.
   * - `sequential-after-transcribe`: waits for transcribe to finish
   *   before encoding — used when transcribe runs a browser-side
   *   worker that would compete with the encoder for the CPU.
