/**
 * Kicks the actor-cutout analysis off for the loaded project, once
 * per project, whenever an active sheet's template starts requiring
 * the effect. The kick-off takes one of two shapes, chosen from what
 * the user was doing at the moment:
 *
 * - The user swapped the template on the current active sheet — an
 *   explicit choice. The dialog opens to ask, and a cancel reverts the
 *   swap so the choice is undone rather than left half-applied.
 * - Any other cause — the template was already picked when the project
 *   loaded, or the active sheet switched onto a behind-actor sheet on
 *   its own. There is nothing to revert, so a cancel would only leave
 *   the template stuck without the analysis it needs. The analysis
 *   starts silently instead, and the playback gate covers what it has
 *   not reached yet.
 *
 * Either way the offer is a one-shot opt-in: once the analyzer has
 * been told to work, nothing here asks or starts again. Two signals
 * carry that decision. This session's acceptance flag stands for
 * "the analyzer is on it right now", surviving the head start's own
 * pending publish. Any `analyzedRanges` on the persisted record stands
 * for "a run happened at some point", surviving a reload. Mask
 * backfills leave `analyzedRanges` empty, so they never count.
 *
 * Coverage of the current captions is not the gate. Re-checking it
 * would reopen the dialog every time the active sheet flips across a
 * section boundary while the drain is still in flight, which is the
 * case reported as "the dialog reopens as I play forward".
