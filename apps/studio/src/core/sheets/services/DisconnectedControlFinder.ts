 * Finds the controls an edit has cut loose: ones the authored sources
 * consumed through a `var()` and the current sources do not.
 *
 * The question is deliberately differential rather than absolute.
 * "Does anything read this control?" cannot be answered from the
 * sources: a control can be consumed by the stylesheet, by the filters
 * document, or by application code that never mentions a variable at
 * all — a palette rotation driven by a `select` works that way. Asking
 * whether a control is read at all would report those as dead while
 * they work perfectly.
 *
 * Asking what an edit removed has no such blind spot. A control the
 * author never wired through these two documents is in neither set and
 * is never reported; one that was wired and no longer is was
 * disconnected by the edit, and by nothing else.
 *
 * Results are control ids rather than variable names, so a caller can
 * match them against the fields it renders.
 *
 * One reading survives that the render does not: a control read only
 * inside an `@keyframes` block counts as read even when no declaration
 * animates that block any more.
