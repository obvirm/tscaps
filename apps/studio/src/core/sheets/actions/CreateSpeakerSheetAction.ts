/**
 * Gives one of the transcript's voices its own sheet and moves its
 * words onto it, leaving every other voice on Main. A scene two voices
 * share is carved between them; each side is re-split under its own
 * sheet's rules afterwards.
 *
 * The sheet is Main with three things changed: a color of its own, the
 * style preset matching the speaker's position, and membership of Main's
 * link group. Linked is the point — a speaker is not a different design,
 * it is the same design in a different colour, so one style edit still
 * reshapes the whole video while each voice keeps its preset. The chain
 * icon on the chip is there for anyone who wants one voice to diverge.
 *
 * Creating the sheet and moving the scenes are one gesture and share one
 * undo entry.
