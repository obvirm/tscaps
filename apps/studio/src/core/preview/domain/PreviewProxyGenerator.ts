 * should treat each call as the only work the main thread is
 * doing for a while and run it inside a blocking pipeline step
 * with a visible splash, not as a side effect during interactive
 * work. Optionally pass `onProgress` to drive a progress bar.

 * left unwrapped so callers can tell it from a generation failure.
