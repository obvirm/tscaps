/**
 * Renderer-agnostic media player abstraction. Plays a video file
 * onto a presentation element the surface owns, with audio routed
 * through a Web Audio graph the surface also owns.
 *
 * The surface is cut-aware: `seek` and natural playback advance in
 * source time, but positions inside an active cut range are skipped
 * over transparently. Consumers operate as if cuts simply did not
 * exist in the timeline.
 *
 * Lifecycle:
 * - `start(container)` creates the surface's presentation element
 *   (a `<canvas>`, a `<video>`, etc., depending on the impl) and
 *   attaches it to the given container. Subsequent calls with a
 *   different container re-parent the element without losing the
 *   loaded source. The consumer is responsible for the container's
 *   layout; the surface's element fills it.
 * - `load(source)` opens a video blob and prepares decoding. Throws
 *   when the codec is not decodable in this browser.
 * - `unload()` releases the decoders and clears the presentation.
 * - `stop()` tears the runtime down and detaches the presentation
 *   element; a later `start` rebuilds it.
 *
 * Emits two events:
 * - `'timechange'` — fired every time `currentTimeSec` advances
 *   during playback. High frequency.
 * - `'change'` — fired when any non-time field of the snapshot
 *   changes (play/pause, volume, rate, video size, ready, failure).
