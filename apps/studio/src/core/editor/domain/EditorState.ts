 * alignment). Sheet assignment lives in the raw Document itself: each raw
 * `Section.kind` holds a Sheet id, and the deriver runs that Sheet's
 * pipeline over the section's raw segments to build the corresponding
 * derived Section (also tagged with `kind`).
 *
 * The `project*` fields identify the persisted Project this state belongs
 * to. They are null/empty until a Project is created (currently triggered
 * at the start of the preprocessing pipeline) or until an existing one is
 * loaded via LoadProjectAction. Save actions gate persistence on
 * `projectId !== null`.
