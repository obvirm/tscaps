/**
 * Boots the errors feature: the three destinations a failure can take
 * and the vocabulary every feature describes one with.
 *
 * Every build reports crashes to the console; a build with a reporting
 * backend configured also sends the report there. The composite hides
 * which channels are active behind one port.
 *
 * Most of the main thread never needs it — the reporting SDK's global
 * handlers already cover anything that propagates. What reaches this
 * port is what those handlers cannot see: a worker's unhandled
 * rejection, and a failure some `catch` recovered from without anybody
 * upstream ever learning it happened.
 *
 * Rules are listed most specific first — the resolver takes the first
 * match, so their order is the tie-break when one failure could be
 * described by two conditions.
 *
 * Boots before every feature module: the notice channel and the
 * classifier are dependencies of the wirings that own the operations
 * able to fail, not of the editor that happens to render them.
