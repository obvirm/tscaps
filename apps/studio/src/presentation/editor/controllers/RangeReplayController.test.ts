/**
 * A replay hands the surface a bound it must not lose. Seeking is what
 * drops a standing bound, so the order the two are asked in is the
 * difference between a stretch that stops and one that plays on to the
 * end of the file.
 *
 * And it takes the playhead from nobody. A user watching their own
 * video is already seeing whatever was just changed; yanking the
 * playhead backwards to show it to them is the one thing they did not
 * ask for.
