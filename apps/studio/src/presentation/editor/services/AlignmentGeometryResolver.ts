 * names an anchor point as a fraction of the frame, and the anchor pins
 * the box's near edge, its centre, or its far edge to that point.
 *
 * Every `box` is the caption's layout box — the box the anchor's grid
 * places, before rotation or the behind-actor lift. A measured client
 * rect carries both transforms and would land the answer off by them.
 *
 * A caption's horizontal anchor may be stated in reading terms, so every
 * call takes the direction the caption reads in and answers in screen
 * terms. Pure: no DOM access, no state.
