 * forward down the stack.
 *

 * running beneath them. Rows already stack downward to mean "later", so
 * a second band of anything would say "later" with its position and "at
 * the same time" with its meaning — which is why sheets that claim the
 * same instant are read in channels of their own instead.
 *

 * kept from sharing an instant, and sheets that share one are never in
 * the same channel. Two words of *one* scene are the exception — both
 * are drawn and the shared stretch is marked, because a scene is a
 * sequence and a pair of its words reads as a pair.
 *
 * Anything longer than a row is cut into one piece per row it crosses,
 * and each piece knows the whole it came from. Every piece of a word
 * carries the whole word's text, so a row can be read on its own.
 *
 * Silences belong to the row rather than to any scene, and are found
 * across every scene at once: a pause in one while another speaks is not
 * a pause. Their ranges come from the shared `SilencePadder`, so cutting
