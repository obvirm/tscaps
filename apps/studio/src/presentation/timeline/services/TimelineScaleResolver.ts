 * How much of the clock a timeline shows, expressed as pixels per

 * Scale is the primitive rather than the duration of a row: a fixed
 * number of seconds per row would squeeze the words on a narrow phone
 * and scatter them on a wide monitor, while a fixed scale keeps a word
 * the same size everywhere and lets the row cover whatever fits.
 *
 * The opening scale is read off the document, because how many seconds
 * a legible chip has to span depends entirely on how fast the speaker
 * talks. With no words to go by, the whole video fits one row.
 *
 * It is read from a short word rather than a typical one: sizing so the
 * *median* word is legible guarantees by definition that half of them
 * are not, and the short ones are exactly the unreadable ones. A low
 * percentile states the goal directly, and being an order statistic it
 * ignores the handful of very long words a hand-written overlay
 * contributes.
