/**
 * Which channel each sheet is read in.
 *
 * The timeline draws **one channel at a time**, and a channel is a single
 * sequence: at any instant it holds at most one scene. That is the whole
 * rule, and everything below follows from it.
 *
 * **The main channel is the only pool.** The main sheet anchors it come
 * what may — it is the transcript, and a reader who had to go looking for
 * it in a list would have lost the thread already. On top of that the pool
 * takes every sheet that overlaps nothing: a hook, or anything else that
 * merely restyles a stretch of the same narration, belongs with it, and
 * splitting those out would mean changing channel to keep reading a
 * transcript straight through.
 *
 * **Every sheet that overlaps something gets a channel to itself**, never
 * shared with another overflow sheet even when the two would fit side by
 * side. Packing them by what happens to fit is interval colouring: the
 * result carries no meaning a reader could name, and one edit repacks
 * tracks the reader never touched. The same algorithm was tried a layer
 * down, assigning scenes to lanes, and removed for the same reasons.
 *
 * Overlap is measured on the **drawn** extent, padding included, because
 * that is what would collide on screen — not on the narrower window an
 * edit is clamped to.
 *
 * A sheet with no segments is in no channel: there is nothing to read.
