 * The window only ever lands on the editing controller as a preview.
 * Writing it for real re-runs the whole effects pipeline over the
 * document, which is fine once on release and hopeless once a frame.
 *
 * The window is held clear of the hard time of the scenes on its own
 * sheet, and inside the video. Shrinking it past its own words is not
 * clamped: a scene may be held on screen for less time than it narrates,
 * and the words stay drawn where they are so the consequence is visible.
 *
 * Snapping happens before the range reaches here, against the landmarks
 * every dragged edge on the timeline shares.
