/**
 * Observable selection state for the Timeline mode. Subscribers listen for
 * `'change'`. The controller deliberately does not own the cuts list —
 * committed cuts live in the editor store so they participate in
 * undo/redo.
 *
 * A selection is a plain time interval, not a per-row range. Rows in
 * the cuts timeline are equal slices of the clock laid end to end, so
 * an interval covering several rows needs no extra bookkeeping: each
 * row renders the part of the interval that falls inside its own
 * bounds.
 *
 * `focusEdge` names the edge the gesture last moved; the opposite edge
 * is the anchor it grew from. Surfaces that must point at "where the
 * user is working" read it.
 *
 * Four gestures are tracked, mutually exclusive:
 *
 * - **Fresh drag-selection** on an empty zone (`startDrag` →
 *   `extendDrag` → `endDrag`).
 * - **Selection edge-drag** (`startEdgeDrag` → `extendDrag` →
 *   `endDrag`) resizes the live selection by anchoring the opposite
 *   edge.
 * - **Cut edge-drag** (`startCutEdit` → `extendCutEdit` →
 *   `endCutEdit`) holds a live preview of a stored cut's new range
 *   without mutating the registry; the consumer commits the result on
 *   release. Starts by clearing any selection so the surface only
 *   shows one ephemeral state at a time.
 * - **Word time edit** (`startWordEdit` → `updateWordEdit` →
 *   `endWordEdit`) holds a live preview of a word's new range, again
 *   committed by the consumer on release.
 *
 * Telling a drag apart from a click is the caller's job, in pixels:
 * every `extendDrag` here is taken at face value. `MIN_SELECTION_SEC`
 * only guards the entry points that name a range outright, where a
 * degenerate range would be meaningless.
