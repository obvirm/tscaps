/**
 * How one kind of element moves everywhere this sheet paints: the
 * answers it can be given, and the fields of whichever is standing.
 *
 * **The template's answer has fields too.** Leaving a kind to the
 * template is not leaving it alone — the template moves it, and the
 * dials over that movement are the ones its own animation declares,
 * starting on the values the template wrote. So the card that means
 * "as the template has it" opens the same kind of panel a picked
 * animation does, and the two never show at once because a kind holds
 * one answer.
 *
 * A template offers no dial where it gave a property two answers, or
 * routed it through a variable of its own. The animation runs either
 * way; only the dial cannot open, which is why nothing is drawn in its
 * place.
 *
 * **A template that writes its own keyframes publishes its own
 * controls**, grouped under the kind they move. Those are ordinary
 * style controls and go on behaving like ones — the sheet stores them
 * beside every other value it was given, and the Style tab leaves them
 * to this panel rather than showing them twice. They go away with the
 * rest the moment the animation is replaced: a sheet's answer takes
 * over the template's, so a dial still sitting there over movement that
 * has been replaced would be describing something nobody can see.
 *
 * **The template's card only appears where the picker cannot name what
 * the template does.** A sheet is not an element with a parent to defer
 * to — nothing is above it — so "as the template has it" is a fact
 * about this panel: where that fact is `rise-in` the panel shows
 * `rise-in`, and where the template moves this kind with nothing it
 * shows None. Reset is what puts a kind back, which is why it is a
 * button beside the strip rather than a card.
 *
 * Picking the card already showing changes nothing and still replays.
 * Watching the motion again is most of why anyone clicks a card they
 * already have, and applying it would move the caption: over the
 * template's own it swaps the template's parameters for the library's.
 *
 * Nothing asks whether the CSS was taken over. A sheet's blocks live in
 * a layer of their own rather than mixed into the text the code editor
 * edits, so the two can never be the same declarations — what is
 * written here simply outranks the template, and a hand-written rule
 * that wants to win says `!important`, which reverses the layer order.
