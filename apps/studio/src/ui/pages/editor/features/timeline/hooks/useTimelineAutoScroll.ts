 * Drives the Timeline mode virtualizer with three scroll behaviors:

 *    Timeline mode (resets the next time they leave and re-enter).
 *  - Follow-along during playback, keeping the row the playhead is in on
 *    screen. Manual edits while paused don't yank the view.
 *  - On-demand scroll to a caller-specified segment whenever the
 *    `scrollRequest` reference changes (used by Locate and search
 *    match navigation).
 *
 * Both of the first two follow the **playhead**, never the scene it is
 * inside. A scene can run for many rows, and the further the two are
 * allowed to drift the more the panel shows a place the video left long
 * ago — badly enough, zoomed in, for the playhead to be off screen
 * entirely.
 *
 * `scrollReady` must flip to true once the virtualizer's scroll
 * element has been resolved by the consumer; otherwise scrolls fire
 * before the element is wired up and silently no-op.
 *
 * `suppressed` holds every scroll that isn't the user's own doing.
 * Moving the content under a pointer that is mid-gesture shifts the
 * mapping from screen position to time, so the range would jump on its
 * own; a deferred scroll request runs once the gesture ends.
